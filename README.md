# unit-8-liri
Repo for LIRI, with Spotify, Bands In Town, and OMDb API calls using Axios package

This app is used to read inputs in node, take those inputs and make API calls with them to one of three databases, depending on which the user chooses: OMDb, Spotify, or Bandsintown. It then returns relevant information about the query that follows the input, and displays it in the console.
